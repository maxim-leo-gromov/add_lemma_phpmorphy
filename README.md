# add_lemma_phpmorphy
This is a simple tool to add new words (lemmas) to phpMorphy (http://phpmorphy.sourceforge.net) dictionary source code.
It is developed within the project funded by a grant from the Russian Science Foundation,
project No. 19-78-10015 “Development of electronic resources for the study of the folk speech culture of the Middle Ob region”
The current version is Russian. However the tool is simple as a chair and can be easily modified to any language supported
by phpMorphy.
